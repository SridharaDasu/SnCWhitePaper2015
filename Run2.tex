\section{Requirements of Run-2 Computing Systems}

The scale of computing resources necessary is directly coupled to the foreseen output from the
detector.  The trigger rates have been increased by an order of magnitude compared to the
original goals at the time of CMS computing TDR. The discovery of Higgs at low mass and
continued investigation of EWK scale physics requires low thresholds. Understanding the trigger
plans and organizing the data in an appropriate way, for example in high and low priority
processing-streams, may be a new direction to explore to flatten the computing resource needs.

\begin{verbatim}
Line between official and private data
More flexibility and faster turn around in official production.  
Private data is more IO limited than today.
